# PFlow Encodec

Implementation of TTS based on paper [P-Flow: A Fast and Data-Efficient Zero-Shot TTS through Speech Prompting](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zNA7u7wtIN). You can check main differences between implementation and paper in [Differences](#difference-from-paper) section.

# Main goal of this project

I have two goals to achieve in this project.

- First, I want to test character-based input with [SeamlessM4T](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11596)'s [Aligner](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication/blob/main/docs/m4t/unity2_aligner_README.md) for English, Korean, Japanese and other languages. but, mainly for three languages mentioned above.
- Second, zero-shot multilingual TTS model. since this model will be trained with sentencepiece tokenizer input, it does not need phonemizer. so, it would be easily adapted to other languages tokenizer supports. check out supported languages of tokenizer [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication/blob/main/src/seamless_communication/cards/nar_t2u_aligner.yaml)

# Samples

Generated Samples from model trained on LibriTTS-R, korean and japanese corpus of AIHub 131 datasets. All samples are decoded with MultiBand-Diffusion model from [AudioCraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/MBD.md).
Pretrained checkpoint used here is available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/seastar105/pflow-encodec-ejk).

you can check how to use it in [sample notebook](https://github.com/seastar105/pflow-encodec/blob/main/notebooks/generate.ipynb).

Currently, speaker embedding of multi-lingual model seems to be highly entangled with language bias. I'm planning to add language ID to reduce language bias in speaker embedding.

# Environment Setup

I've developed in WSL, Windows 11. I have not tested on other platforms and torch version. I recommend using conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n pflow-encodec -y python=3.10
conda activate pflow-encodec
conda install -y pytorch==2.2.0 torchvision==0.17.0 torchaudio==2.2.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -y -c conda-forge libsndfile==1.0.31
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r infer-requirements.txt
```

# Dataset Preparation

## meta tsv file

First of all, you need to prepare tsv file, which contains three columns: `audio_path`, `text`, `duration`. each column is separated by tab.

`audio_path` is path to audio file, `text` is transcript of audio file, and `duration` is duration of audio file in seconds.

### Example

```tsv
audio_path	text	duration
/path/to/audio1.wav	Hello, World!	1.5
/path/to/audio2.wav ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî, ÏÑ∏Í≥Ñ!	2.0
/path/to/audio3.wav „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ„ÄÅ‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ	2.5
```

## Dump encodec latent and sentencepiece token durations

Here, use encodec latent as output, and duration per token as target of duration predictor.

you can dump encodec latent and sentencepiece token durations with following command.

```bash
python scripts/dump_durations.py --input_tsv <meta_tsv_file>
python scripts/dump_latents.py --input_tsv <meta_tsv_file>
```

this command requires GPU and `scripts/dump_durations.py` may require more than 8GB of GPU memory.

`scripts/dump_durations.py` takes about 6 hours for 1000 hours of audio files. `scripts/dump_latents.py` takes about 4 hours for 1000 hours of audio files. both time was measured on RTX 4090.

each script will make two files per audio file:
`<audio_path stem>.latent.npy` and `<audio_path stem>.duration.npy`.

**NOTE: `scripts/dump_latents.py` will print out global mean and std of dataset's latent. You should keep it since this value is used for training model.**

Now, you can start training.

# Train Model

Repository's code is based on [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).

After preparing dataset, you can start training after setting dataset config and experiment config. Let your dataset name be `new_dataset`. first you need to set dataset config in `configs/data/new_dataset.yaml`.

```yaml
_target_: pflow_encodec.data.datamodule.TextLatentLightningDataModule

train_tsv_path: <train_tsv_path>
val_tsv_path: <val_tsv_path>
add_trailing_silence: True
batch_durations: 50.0   # mini-batch duration in seconds
min_duration: 3.5    # minimum duration of files, this value MUST be bigger than 3.0
max_duration: 15.0
boundaries: [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0]
num_workers: 8
return_upsampled: False
max_frame: 1500 # 20s
text2latent_rate: 1.5 # 50Hz:75Hz
mean: <mean>
std: <std>
```

fill `<train_tsv_path>`, `<val_tsv_path>`, `<mean>`, and `<std>` with your dataset's meta path and mean/std values.

then, create config in `configs/experiment/new_dataset.yaml`.

```yaml
# @package _global_

defaults:
  - override /data: new_dataset.yaml # your dataset config name here!!!
  - override /model: pflow_base.yaml
  - override /callbacks: default.yaml
  - override /trainer: gpu.yaml
  - override /logger: tensorboard.yaml

task_name: pflow
tags: ["pflow"]
seed: 998244353
test: False

callbacks:
  val_checkpoint:
    filename: "val_latent_loss_{val/latent_loss:.4f}-{step:06d}"
    monitor: val/latent_loss
    mode: "min"
model:
  scheduler:
    total_steps: ${trainer.max_steps}
    pct_start: 0.02
  sample_freq: 5000
  mean: ${data.mean}
  std: ${data.std}
trainer:
  max_steps: 500000
  max_epochs: 10000 # arbitrary large number
  precision: bf16-mixed # you should check if your GPU supports bf16
  accumulate_grad_batches: 4    # effective batch size
  gradient_clip_val: 0.2
  num_nodes: 1
  devices: 1
hydra:
  run:
    dir: <fill experiment result path>
```

now you can run training with following command.

```bash
python pflow_encodec/train.py experiment=new_dataset
```

**NOTE: If you want to train model with multiple GPUs, you should adjust trainer.num_nodes and trainer.devices in experiment config. Also you should set trainer.use_distributed_sampler to be False. For more detailed information, check out Pytorch Lightning's documents.**

Example of single node 4 gpus

```
trainer:
  num_nodes: 1
  devices: 4
  use_distributed_sampler: False
```

# Difference from paper

I did not conduct ablation studies for each changes due to lack of resources.

- Use [Encodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/ENCODEC.md) instead of MelSpectrogram.
- Use character-base input instead of phoneme, and GT duration as a target of duration predictor instead of MAS.
- Use AdaLN-Zero from [DiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09748) for speaker-conditioned text encoder instead of concat and self-attention.
- Use transformer as Flow Matching decoder instead of Wavenet blocks with AdaLN-Single timestep conditioning from [PixArt-Œ±](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00426)
- Use attention pooling instead of mean pooling to get fixed-size speaker embedding as P-Flow used in their ablation study.
- Use conv-feedforward(FFT Block from Fastspeech) and GeGLU
- Use Alibi + Convolution positional encoding in transformer, from data2vec 2.0 and voicebox
- Use null cond for CFG sampling instead of mean-pooled hidden vectors.
